# image_stitching
This algorithm runs through  a set of images, and stitches them together to form a single image.
# Quick Start
Getting the app to run is pretty easy, just follow the script below! This script will not install OpenCV or Numpy

```bash
 # Clone the repo
 git clone https://github.com/congmingdeyezi/image_stitching.git && cd image_stitching

 # install deps
 make install

 # Run the algorithm!
 python image_stitching.py <path to image directory> --display --save
```
